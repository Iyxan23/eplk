Epic programming language named Eplk, short for Extensible Programming Language in Kotlin

## FAQs

### Why make an interpreted language in kotlin?
Well, yes I do know that kotlin is not the best choice as it's quite slow (+ eplk is literally an interpreted language), but I'm targeting EPLK to be intergrated with android apps very easily. And also this is a for-fun project in which so I can learn stuff about making an interpreted language, therefore I do whatever I want here <img width=20px src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/846626029535625216.png"/>

### What's the point of making this?
First of all, I always wanted to learn on how a programming language works, and also building my own!. Second, I wanted a language that is very easily integrated to android. With EPLK, you can create your own Object, Classes, Functions in kotlin / java without messing around with EPLK itself (Coming soon). Third, This project gives me more experience in using kotlin, I'm quite new to kotlin afterall.
